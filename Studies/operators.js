/**
 * Javascript Operators:
 * 
 * Operators are symbols used to perform operators on data.

// 1. Assignment Operators

let name = 'Colton' // = is the assignment operator, assigns the value 'Colton' to name

// 2. Arithmetic Operators
let sum = 1 + 1; // + is the addition operator
let difference = 10 - 5; // - is the subtraction operator
let multiply = 5 * 2; // * is the multiplication operator
let quotient = 10 / 5; // / is the division operator
let remainder = 10 % 2; // % is the modulo operator to calculate remainder

// 3. Comparison Operators
let isLooselyEqual = (x == 100); // == checks for equality of value
let isStrictlyEqual (x === 10); // checks for equality of value and type
let isNotEqual = (1 != 2); // checks if values are not equal
let isGreaterThan = (10 > 1); // checks if first value is greater than second
let isLessThan (1 < 10); // checks if first value is less than second

// 4. Logical Operators
let and = (x < 5 && x > 1) // returns true if both conditions are true
let or = (x < 5 || x > 1) // returns true if one condition is true
let negate = !(x == 10); // negates the result, returns true if condition is false

// 5. Unary Operators
i++; // increments the value of i by 1
i--; // decrements the value of i by 1

// 6. Ternary Operator
let result = (x > 10) ? 'Greater than 10' : 'Less than or equal to 10';
// checks condition, executes first expression if true, second if false
