/** 
 * VARIABLES:
 * 
 * 0. To hold things in memory during the life cycle of a 
 * program, we can use variables. Variables are named
 * identifiers that can point to values of a particular
 * type, like a Number, String, Boolean, Array, Object
 * or another data-type. Variables are called so because
 * once created, we can CHANGE the value (and type of value)
 * to which they point.
 * 
 * 1. To create a variable we use the keyword, var, 
 * followed by a name (id or alias) for our variable.
 * 
 * 2. There are 2 phases of using variables: declaration
 * and initialization (or assignment).
 */

// 1. Declaration 
// At the declaration phase, the variable myName is undefined because we have NOT initialized it to anything
var myName;
console.log(myName); // prints => undefined

// 2. Initialization or Assignment
// Hwne you assign a value to an undeclared variable
myName = 'john';
console.log(myName); // prints => john

// 3. Re-Assignment 
// Changing or updating the value of a previously assigned variable
myName = 'bob';
console.log(myName); // prints => bob

// 4. Var, let, and const

// var example //


// let example //


// const example //
