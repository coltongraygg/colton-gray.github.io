// Each section must have...

// intro for each section (like in the below variable example)

/**
 * variables:
 * 
 * 0. To hold things in memory during the life-cycle of a program, we can use variables.
 * Variables are named identifiers that can point to values of a particular type, 
 * like a Number, String, Boolean, Array, Object, or another data-type. 
 * Variables are called so because once created, we can CHANGE the value (and type of value) to which they point.
 * 
 * 1. To create a variable we can use the keyword, var, followed by a name (id or alias) for our variable.
 * 
 * 2. There are 2 phases of using variables: declaration and initialization (or assignment).
 */

// each section must also have a clear explanation for each concept

// 1. declaration //
/* 
At the declaration phase, the variable myName is undefined becase we have NOT initialized it to anything
*/
// each section must also have working code examples for each concept
// with comment of what each code example should log/return

var myName;
console.log(myName); // prints => undefined
